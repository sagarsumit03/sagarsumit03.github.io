# Algorithm-Datastructure-Implementation
Implementation of different data structures and the algorithms with useful charts and animations



This is my work and understanding on Algorithms their working time 
and the Data Structure implementation in JAVA.


The Code is not overly optimized,
but is written neatly with all coding standards, and test cases.

### Trees:
   * Trees.
   * Binary Search Tree.
   * Balanced BST.
   * AVL Trees.
   * Red-Black Tree
   * Find minimum spanning tree
   
   
### Paths:
   * Dijkstra's algorithm
   * Prim's algorithm
   * Floyd-Warshall algorithm
   
### Graphs:
  * Graph traversal
